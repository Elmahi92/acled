## Idea

The goal of this app is to provide a simple system for monitoring the fast-changing situation in Sudan, with the potential to extend it for tracking crises in other countries. The app is designed to be easy for users to navigate and find information without any hassle, offering a user-friendly interface. The UI, as shown in the [[Blueprint]], has two main sections:

1. **General Statistics** – This section shows key numbers and trends related to the ongoing conflict, including month-over-month changes.
2. **Chatbot** – In this section, we leverage existing models to provide a chatbot that can answer questions about the current situation. This idea is inspired by the article [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-humanitarian-crises-situation-report-ai-assistant-exploring-llmops-with-prompt-flow-32968b7a878b) and includes additional analysis from ACLED data to give a clear picture of the overall situation.

## Tools

To make development faster and easier, we’ll use Streamlit as the main tool to build the app. Streamlit is user-friendly, well-supported by its community, and a convenient choice for this type of project.
